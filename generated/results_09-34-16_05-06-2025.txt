Summarized Text
The ENSG00000128245 gene, located on chromosome 22 between positions 31944522 and 31957603, encodes the protein-coding gene YWHAH (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, eta polypeptide). This gene, also known as YWHA1, is part of the 14-3-3 protein family, specifically the eta isoform, and plays a role in signal transduction and other cellular processes by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins.
The gene ENSG00000166913, located on chromosome 20 at positions 44885702-44908532, is a protein-coding gene known as YWHAB. This gene encodes the protein kinase C inhibitor protein-1, also known as tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein beta, and belongs to the 14-3-3 protein family, specifically identified as the beta/alpha isoform. YWHAB is also associated with alternative names like HEL-S-1, HS1, and KCIP-1, highlighting its role in various cellular processes.
The gene ENSG00000108953, located on chromosome 17 (chr17: 1344275-1400222), encodes the protein-coding gene *YWHAE*, also known as 14-3-3 epsilon. This gene produces a protein involved in signal transduction, acting as a phosphoserine/threonine-binding protein that regulates diverse cellular processes through protein-protein interactions.  *YWHAE* has been associated with various aliases and functions, including protein kinase C inhibition, mitochondrial import stimulation, and roles in processes related to tyrosine and tryptophan monooxygenase activation.
The gene ENSG00000170027, located on chromosome 7 (chr7:76326799-76358991), encodes the protein-coding gene *YWHAG*. Also known by aliases such as PPP1R170, 14-3-3GAMMA, and KCIP-1, the *YWHAG* gene produces the gamma polypeptide of the tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, commonly known as 14-3-3 protein gamma. This protein is involved in protein kinase C inhibition and the regulation of protein phosphatase 1, and has been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 56 (EIEE56/DEE56).
The gene ENSG00000134308, located on chromosome 2 between positions 9583967 and 9630997, encodes the protein-coding gene YWHAQ. This gene is associated with the protein known as 14-3-3 theta (also referred to as tyrosine/tryptophan monooxygenase activation protein theta). This protein belongs to the 14-3-3 family, a group of proteins known for their role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. Its HGNC designation is HGNC:12854.
The gene ENSG00000175793, located on chromosome 1 between positions 26863149 and 26864456, encodes the protein-coding gene SFN (also known as YWHAS, stratifin, or 14-3-3 protein sigma). SFN is considered an epithelial cell marker protein 1 and its official symbol is HGNC:10773.
