ID,Summary
ENSG00000128245,"The gene ENSG00000128245, located on chromosome 22 (chr22) at positions 31944522-31957603, is a protein-coding gene that encodes the protein YWHAH, also known as 14-3-3 eta (14-3-3Î·). This protein functions as a tyrosine/tryptophan monooxygenase activation protein and belongs to the 14-3-3 protein family, which are known to be involved in a wide range of cellular processes."
ENSG00000166913,"The gene ENSG00000166913, designated as YWHAB (HGNC:12849), is a protein-coding gene located on chromosome 20, spanning from base pairs 44885702 to 44908532.  It encodes the protein known as tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, beta polypeptide (also known as 14-3-3 protein beta/alpha) which is involved in a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. This protein is also known by several aliases, including KCIP-1 and HS1."
ENSG00000108953,"The gene ENSG00000108953, located on chromosome 17 between positions 1344275 and 1400222, encodes the protein-coding gene *YWHAE*.  *YWHAE*, also known by numerous aliases including 14-3-3 epsilon and KCIP-1, produces the 14-3-3 protein epsilon, a protein involved in a variety of cellular processes including protein kinase C inhibition and tyrosine/tryptophan monooxygenase activation."
ENSG00000170027,"The gene ENSG00000170027, located on chromosome 7 (chr7: 76326799-76358991), encodes the protein-coding gene *YWHAG*, which produces the 14-3-3gamma protein. This protein, also known under other names like protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 170 (PPP1R170) and protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1 (KCIP-1), is a member of the 14-3-3 protein family involved in regulating diverse cellular processes via protein-protein interactions. Mutations in *YWHAG* have been associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 56 (DEE56/EIEE56)."
ENSG00000134308,"The gene ENSG00000134308, located on chromosome 2 between positions 9583967 and 9630997, encodes the protein-coding gene YWHAQ. YWHAQ is also known as 14-3-3 theta and functions as a tyrosine/tryptophan monooxygenase activation protein involved in diverse cellular processes."
ENSG00000175793,"The gene ENSG00000175793, located on chromosome 1 between positions 26863149 and 26864456, encodes the protein-coding gene SFN (also known as YWHAS, stratifin, or 14-3-3 sigma). SFN encodes a 14-3-3 protein isoform implicated in various cellular processes and is recognized as an epithelial cell marker. Its official HGNC symbol is HGNC:10773."
